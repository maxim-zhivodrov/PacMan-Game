# Pac-Man Game

Hello, welcome to "MSPacman" !!!

This project is a complete Pac-Man game from scratch.\
The game was written using HTML5 and JQuery javascript library.

You can check out the game in the link below:\

### Instructions
In order to start the game you either have to register (press "Sign Up" button) with your own register parameters\
or if you already has a user, you can log in (press "Log in" button) with your username and password.

If you want to play with a default username, you can just log in with a username "p" and a password "p".

In the "Options screen" you can set all your favorite parameters for the game or hit the "random" button and the game parameters will be set randomly.

In the "Game playing screen" there are few things you should know about them:

- First functionality that has been added is the "Slow motion". You can see a snail icon that "jumps" every few seconds to other place on the board.
If the pacman eats the snail, all the monsters will move slow for a few seconds (and the game music will start to play with slow motion too :)).

- Second functionality that has been added is the "God mode" power. You can see a green tube icon that "stands" on the same place on the board.
If the pacman eats the tube, the pacman turns to green and gets power for a few seconds. The power is that every time the pacman tackles with a monster, the pacman will not die  
and the specific monster that the pacman tackled with will be pushed to its initial place on the board.

- Third functionality that has been added is the "Extra points". A moving star icon that if the pacman eats it, 50 points will be added to his score.

- A "Restart" button that will start a new game with the same game parameters you have chosen before.

- A "New game" button that will open again the "Options scree" that you can to choose new game parameters and that start a new game.

- If the music or the sound disturbes you, you can hit on the "Music button" and "Sound button" on the right of the screen to turn off and turn on the music and the sound. 


Hope you enjoyed the game.
